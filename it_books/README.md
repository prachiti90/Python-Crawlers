# My first Scrapy Crawler

- This is my first scrapy crawler. 
- The Crawler is run on the site http://it-ebooks.info/.
- The crawler is similar to the demo scraper, present in the Scrapy Tutorial.

I created this crawler with virtualenv in python 2.7. and Scrapy version 0.24.4

The steps followed for this and all the other crawlers are present in the crawling_steps.md in the parent directory.
