#Recursive Scraping

- In this spider I explore recursive scraping with the same site http://it-ebooks.info/
- For this you must be familiar with:
  1. Regular Expression
  2. X-Path 
  3. What is SgmlLinkExtractor?
  4. What are CrawlSpiders?
  5. What are Rules in CrawlSpider?
  
- Please see the resources for all these.
- For X-Path i use Firefox Firebug. A relatively simple but powerful plugin.
- There is no tutorial better then the Scrapy Documentation for each of the above concepts.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Happy Crawling..!
